My story begins in a beautiful island in the southern Caribbean Sea by the name of Grenada (pronounced 
Gree-nay-duh and NOT Gra-nah-dah). Soon after I was born my parents, brother, sister and I moved to Canada 
for three years then to Maryland for two, where my father held jobs with the Grenadian government. 

At the age of six I returned home and began my primary school education. Eleven years later I graduated 
from secondary school and went on to attend the T.A. Marryshow Community College where I graduated with an 
Associate's degree in Building Construction Technology and CAPE certificates in Applied Mathematics and 
Physics. I was lucky to be hired right after graduation with a construction and design company for two years 
before leaving to begin studies here at the Illinois Institute of Technology.

I am currently pursuing a professional Bachelor's degree in Architecture with the hopes of one day returning 
home to develop my own global firm after travelling the world on an intensely enjoyable quest for new 
cultural and personal experience. My main hobby, which I sadly do not get enough time for, is dancing. 
Should all else fail, I will dance (cue stage lights and dramatic music).

This web design class seems perfect for me since I not only needed one more humanities course, but have been 
struggling to design a web presence for a start up venture back home. By the end of this course I will 
hopefully have: a) one more skill to add to my arsenal and b) the beginnings of a satisfactory web page for 
my business.

All in all, things are what you make it. School is tough. But life is life, and everything else is everything else.
